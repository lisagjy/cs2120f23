Your homework, due before class on Wednesday, is to complete
the definition of the general foldr function, with the reduction
of lists of strings to Boolean values as a test case, true if
every string in a list is of even length, and false otherwise.
Your foldr function must be completely general and not test-case
specific, however the function that we are calling "combine" will
be application/test-case specific. To do the homework, complete
the following definitions by replacing the underscores with your own code.-/

def isEvenLen : String → Bool := λ s => s.length % 2 == 0
def combine : String → Bool → Bool := λ a b => (isEvenLen a) ∧ b

#reduce combine "lifee" true

def foldr {α β : Type} : (α → β → β) → β → List α → β
| _, id, List.nil => id
| op, id, (h::t) => op h (foldr op id t)

#reduce foldr combine true ["life","and"]
